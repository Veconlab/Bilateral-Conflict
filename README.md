Data and Research Paper Charles Holt and Tom Palfrey
The data analysis is divided between two treatments, 
equal absolute change (48 subjects, 12 per session) 
and equal proportional change (48 subjects 12 per session).  
There is an Excel data file for each treatment, 
equal absolute change or equal proportional change, 
since all data analysis is treatment specific.  
The excel file for each treatment has sorted data 
for each of the 4 sessions in that treatment,
with column headings:
Session, Treatment,	Round, ID, Role (1=row, 2=col_attacker), 
Decision (1=Top,1=Left), Other ID, Other Decision, Earnings, Cumulative Earnings
